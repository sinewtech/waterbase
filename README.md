Free, open source and self-hosted BaaS sdk by Sinewave. 

## Why
We wanted to have the challenge of something really big...
Plus this a free and open source version of Firebase that we can use on our inhouse projects

## How
Waterbase is done with a simple OOP SDK made in typescript, that uses http calls to the server that the user has setup, if you would like to know more about the server please take a look to the repo [waterbase server](https://github.com/sinewtech/waterbase-server).

## Documentation
Even though that our SDK is made with TsDoc comments for modern text editor,
