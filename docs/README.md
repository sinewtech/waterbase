# :droplet: Waterbase

Free, open source and self-hosted firebase.

## Why

We wanted to have the challenge of something really big...
Plus this a free and open source version of Firebase that we can use on our inhouse projects

## How

Waterbase is done with a simple OOP SDK made in typescript, that uses http calls to the server that the user has setup, if you would like to know more about the server please take a look to the repo [waterbase server](https://github.com/sinewtech/waterbase-server).
